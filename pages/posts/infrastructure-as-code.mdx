In the middle of the afternoon, I had a casual chat with my co-mentor. We were discussing the HashiTalks event coming up on July 29th.

There are so many interesting topics to be covered. My co-mentor mentioned a few key ones:

    Packer: for creating VM images (supports KVM)
    Vagrant: for building VMs (supports VirtualBox, Docker)
    Terraform: for building cloud infrastructure (supports AWS, Linode, etc.)
    Consul: for networking (supports clusters, load balancing, multi-data center/zone)
    Boundary: (not applicable)
    Vault: for storing keys and secrets (supports .env files in apps, SSL, etc.)
    Nomad: for container orchestration (supports HA, Docker, Kubernetes)
    Waypoint: provides a modern workflow to build, deploy, and release across platforms (not applicable)

I copied his chat directly, haha. I think I should write about these topics later.

    Infra as code, are you ready to rock? ğŸ˜›

Thanks, Pak! Let me sharpen my ax first.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
