When a website is down, server resources are high, and usually it was an infection
on the site. It's crucial to act quickly to identify and mitigate the issue.

Here's my general step-by-step guide to identify if WordPress site is infected
and some possible ways to mitigate it.

## Check Server Resource Usage

Using SSH into your server, run the almighty `top` command to see what's happen.

Look for processes consuming high CPU, memory, or disk I/O. Suspicious processes
could indicate malicious activity.

They usually ran with unknown and unique process name that you probably never
knew before.

Curious what the name would be? I had a bucket of malware files in the past.

You can find them here:

## Check Process File Location

I prefer using `lsof -p $PID` to check where is the file located.

Then I set the permission to zero "000" and set immutable to that file, just to
prevent it to be run again.

```
chmod 000 public_html/path/malicious_file
chattr +i public_html/path/malicious_file
```

## Finding the Breadcrumbs

tbc.. generally using grep, find, etc.

again, you must search something like in these examples:

## Check Cronjob

Another usual things to check is in the cronjob. Malicious actor can put some task
in your cronjob, you can check using `crontab -l` or check under directory `/etc/cron*`

## Security Plugin

It's worth to have security plugin such as Wordfence, or you can find the others.

There is so many, but I prefer [Wordfence](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/).

## Broken WordPress System

Main thing to do is to download WordPress core system to avoid any damaged.

Using WP CLI command is fine enough.

```
wp core download --force 

# Don't worry, it's safe.
```
