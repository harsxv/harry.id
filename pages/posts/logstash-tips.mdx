Sometimes, I need to reconfigure Logstash config. 

Without restart the services, just send a SIGHUP to the running Logstash process.

    $ pgrep -U logstash
    17913
    $ kill -SIGHUP 17913

You can see on Logstash log, it just already reloads.

    $ tail -f /var/log/logstash/logstash-plain.log
    [2021-05-09T16:35:12,815][WARN ][logstash.runner          ] SIGHUP received.
    [2021-05-09T16:35:14,184][INFO ][logstash.pipelineaction.reload] Reloading pipeline {"pipeline.id"=>:main}
    [2021-05-09T16:35:17,143][INFO ][logstash.javapipeline    ][main] Pipeline terminated {"pipeline.id"=>"main"}

My new Logstash config has been successfuly reloaded and ready to process a bunch of log again.
