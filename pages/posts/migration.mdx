So, I've been using GhostCMS for a long time, but now, for some reason, I can't host it anymore.

I've decided to migrate my entire blog and change my domain from harry.coffee to harry.id.

I need to cut back and save some money since the .coffee TLD is more expensive than the .id TLD.

Let's see if this helps the site last longer.

Over the next few days, I'll be migrating all my content from the previous Ghost site to this new one.

By the way, this theme is forked from [unix.bio](https://github.com/unix/unix.bio). Thanks!
