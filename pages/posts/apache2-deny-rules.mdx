esterday, I've had some task to make restriction to some web apps.

It's use Apache2 as web service. Unfortunately, I bit confused about the restriction setup because I often used [NGINX ](https://serverguy.com/comparison/apache-vs-nginx/)as web service. 

Then, I knew that some syntax configuration are different even just between minor version.

    # Apache 2.2
    
    order deny,allow
    allow from 12.34.5.67
    allow from 98.76.54.32
    deny from all
    
    # Apache 2.4
    
    Require ip 12.34.5.67
    Require ip 98.76.54.32

Don't forget about the required [Apache modules](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_authz_core.html). I will wrote about this later.

*also, the `order` syntax are different between `deny,allow` and `allow,deny` . [smh](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_authz_host.html#page-header).

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
