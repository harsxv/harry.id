This posts I created to notes what recurring commands I always used for.

    Find some file older than 90 day then delete  
    $ find -name '$file' -mtime +90 -delete
    
    Show all IP Address from server
    $ hostname -I
    
    ...

I will keep this post updated.

..not a promise

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
