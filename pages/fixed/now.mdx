# Now 

I'm a system engineer and newcomer fish and gecko keeper.

This site is my aquarium - just a little space of me and the others.
My works, experiment, or thought of something, I may write down here.
In case you need to know a bit more about me, just let's go grab some [coffee](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Coffee+Shop/@-7.7973398,110.3543402,13z/data=!3m1!4b1).
